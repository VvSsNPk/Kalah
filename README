This is the template for a KGP agent using Java.  It contains the
following files to get started:

* Agent.java

  We suggest you implement your agent in this file.  It imports the
  library that you don't have to touch.

* jkgp.jar

  This archive contains the entire library.  As long as it is placed
  in the classpath, Java will find and use it.  We have rendered the
  Javadoc here:

    https://wwwcip.cs.fau.de/~el82onyk/jkgp_doc/

* ABOUT

  The file describing your submission.  We require your team to be
  able and provide at least a basic description of their approach.
  This file also contains a list of all your team members. DO NOT
  FORGET to fill it out before submitting your solution.

* Dockerfile

  The actual tournament makes use of Docker containers[0], and we want
  all submissions to be uploaded with a functional "Dockerfile" (that
  describes how the agent is built and executed).

  If you use additional third-party libraries, make sure they are also
  fetched and initialised in the Dockerfile.  In case you change the
  directory structure, please also make sure that the Dockerfile still
  builds sucessfully.

* practice.sh

  Use this script to your agent connect to the public practice
  server (https://kalah.kwarc.info).  This is just a convenience
  feature, you don't have to use it.

* prepare.sh

  Use this script to bundle your agent and all related files into a
  complete submission.  The script will try and to some basic checks
  to make sure all the necessary conditions for a submission are met.
  Not all submissions that pass this script are necessarily correct,
  but if the script emits an error or a warning, there is probably
  something wrong.

If you have any issues, please refer to the information on the public
practice server:
